# lattice_sum
Recursively finds all the non-negative integer points x_i : i=1..n such that x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = r , where r is an integer

## Scope
Given a number of dimensions n and an integer r, it finds all the vectors ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%20%5Cin%20%7B%5Crm%20I%5C%21R%7D%5E&plus;%20%5Ccup%20%5C%7B%200%20%5C%7D%20%3D%20%5C%7B%20x_1%2C%20x_2%2C%20x_3%2C%20%5Cldots%2C%20x_n%20%5C%7D) such that ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20x_i%20%3D%20r).

## Validation
In test_lattice_plane a graphical and a multidimensional validation is performed.

## Known issues
It tends to perform more iterations than necessary (essentially finding many duplicate points), that's why a set is used in the helper function.
